Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</span></p><p><b>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US (INCLUDING DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY), WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS, AS WELL AS CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, ARE NOT PERMITTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.</b></p><p>You and we each agree that you and we are further waiving our respective rights to sue or go to court to assert or defend our rights under this User Agreement. You and we each agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.</p><p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other CareGLP users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p><p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local \"small claims\" court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p><p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your CareGLP account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them to:</p><p>CareValidate<br/>CareValidate, Inc.<br/>4575 Webb Bridge Road<br/>Suite 4345<br/>Alpharetta, GA 30005<br/>support@CareValidate.com</p><p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your CareGLP account, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek.</p><p>Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to:</p><p>CareValidate, Inc.<br/>4575 Webb Bridge Road<br/>Suite 4345<br/>Alpharetta, GA 30005<br/>support@CareValidate.com</p><p>Before arbitration commences, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your CareGLP account, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p><p>The costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p><p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for Georgia, or a state court located in Fulton County, Georgia. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.</p><p>The laws of the State of Georgia, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p><p><b>Governing Law.</b> The Platform is controlled and operated by Us from the United States and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country, or territory other than that of the United States. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia without regard to conflicts of law principles.</p><p><b>Arbitration Agreement.</b> You and CareGLP agree that all claims and disputes relating in any way to your use of our Platform, or arising out of or in connection with these Terms, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, on an individual basis, except for disputes which can be resolved in small claims court, any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents, or any dispute already pending at the time you first agree to these Terms. You also agree that any arbitration will take place in Fulton County, Georgia.</p><p><b>Arbitration Rules.</b> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Any arbitration between you and CareValidate will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available at www.adr.org.</p><p><b>Waiver of Jury Trial.</b></p><p>IN THE EVENT ARBITRATION IS CONTRARY TO APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND CAREVALIDATE WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.</p><p>You and CareValidate are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration is the referral of a claim or dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the claim or dispute and making a final binding determination to resolve it instead of having it decided by a judge or jury in court. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><b>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions, or Representative Actions.</b> YOU AND CAREVALIDATE AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION, OR ON BEHALF OF ANY INDIVIDUAL OR OTHER GROUP. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND CAREVALIDATE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S) OR DISPUTE. ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER CAREGLP USERS.</p><p>This Mandatory Arbitration will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p><p><span class=\"section-heading\">XXII. Copyright Infringement</span></p><p>CareValidate reserves the right to remove any content or any other material or information available on or through our Platform, at any time, for any reason. CareValidate and CareGLP otherwise comply with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. § 512, as amended), and responds to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. This Section XXII describes the procedure that should be followed to file a notification of alleged copyright infringement with CareValidate.</p><p><b>Notification of Claimed Copyright Infringement.</b> If you have objections to copyrighted content or material made available on or through our Platform, you may submit a notification to our Designated Agent at the following address: support@carevalidate.com.</p><p>Any notification to CareValidate regarding CareGLP under 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) alleging copyright infringement must include the following information:</p><p>1.

Miscellaneous</span></p><p>The Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter herein. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect. Headings are for reference only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to any failure by you or others to comply with these Terms does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar failures. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent, and any assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be null and void.</p><p><span class=\"section-heading\">XXIV.
